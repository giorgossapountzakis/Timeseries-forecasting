This project was about timeseries forecasting , meaning that our task was to train a neural network to predict
future samples of a multivariate time series. We feed the network with past observations and we want it to learn 
how to exploit them so as to predict the future . To be precise we use 7 categories {'Sponginess', 'Wonder level',
'Crunchiness', 'Loudness on impact','Meme creativity', 'Soap slipperiness', 'Hype root'} with 68528 observations in
each so a total of 479,696 samples dataset . We first inspect our dataset and provide the relevant plots before and
after normalisation . One problem that we are from the start trying to solve is the selection of proper window length,
stride and telescope numbers . After a lot of testing we concluding that best results happen using telescope 864 (direct forecasting)
and window 200 , stride 20. Now about the model itself we tried a lot of different ones deep biderectional or not  LSTMs or GRUS ,
with dropout layers and even tried to apply different attention mechanisms  but in the end the better results occured when 
we used a simple RNN model followed just by a dense layer and a reshaping in the end so as for the output to have the
appropriate dimentions . We used early stopping to avoid overfitting .
A very important aspect of this project was also the preprocessing and postprocessing of the data. In the preprocessing part
we selected the minimum and maximum number of each category independently and used them for normalisation in each category .
Then for the postprocessing we denormalised the predictions .
All in all if there is one thing that this project taught us is that a deep and complex network does not guarantee 
a better result , but depending on the problem that we want to solve we should adapt our network accordingly.
